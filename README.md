# Circularly Polarized Dielectric Resonator Antenna for Millimeter Waves

## Overview

This repository contains the design, simulation, and analysis of a **Circularly Polarized Dielectric Resonator Antenna (CP DRA)**, created during the Winter Internship Training Program (2023â€“2024) at MNNIT Allahabad under the guidance of Dr. Anand Sharma. The project focuses on a 5.2 GHz antenna for millimeter-wave applications, demonstrating significant potential for communication and sensing systems.

## Key Features
- **Circular Polarization**: Achieved through a coaxial feed and parasitic dielectric cylinder.
- **Wide Bandwidth**: An impedance bandwidth of 5.2 GHz and an axial ratio bandwidth of 40%.
- **High Gain**: Simulated peak gain of 6.5 dB.
- **Efficiency**: Designed with fabrication simplicity and high radiation efficiency in mind.

## Tools and Techniques
- **High-Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS)**: Used for modeling and optimizing the antenna's performance.
- **Parametric Analysis**: To achieve the desired circular polarization and gain characteristics.

## Applications
- 5G communication networks
- Satellite communication
- Radar systems
- Wireless sensing technologies

## Repository Structure
- **/Design**: Contains HFSS project files and schematics.
- **/Simulations**: Includes results like S-parameters, axial ratio, radiation patterns, and gain plots.
- **/Reports**: Final internship report detailing the project methodology, results, and conclusions.
